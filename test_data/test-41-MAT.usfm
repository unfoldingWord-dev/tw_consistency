\p
\v 1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ son of David son of Abraham.
\v 2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers. 
\v 3 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram. 

\s5
\v 4 Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon.
\v 5 Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,
\v 6 Jesse was the father of David the king.
\p David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah.

\s5
\v 7 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa.
\v 8 Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah.

\s5
\v 9 Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.
\v 10 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah.
\v 11 Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.

\s5
\p
\v 12 And after the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel was an ancestor of Zerubbabel.
\v 13 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor.
\v 14 Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud.

\s5
\v 15 Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob.
\v 16 Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.
\v 17 All the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.

\s5
\p
\v 18 The birth of Jesus Christ happened in the following way. His mother, Mary, was engaged to marry Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 Her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man, but he did not want to disgrace her publicly. So he decided to secretly end his engagement with her.

\s5
\v 20 As he thought about these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, because the one who is conceived in her is conceived by the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 She will give birth to a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."

\s5
\v 22 All this happened to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
\q
\v 23 "Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son,
\q and they will call his name Immanuel"â€”
\q which means, "God with us."

\s5
\v 24 Joseph woke up from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and he took her as his wife.
\v 25 But he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.

\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, learned men from the east arrived in Jerusalem saying,
\v 2 "Where is he who was born King of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
\v 3 When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

\s5
\v 4 Herod brought together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and he asked them, "Where is the Christ to be born?"
\v 5 They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what was written by the prophet,
\q
\v 6 'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
\q are not the least among the leaders of Judah,
\q for from you will come a ruler
\q who will shepherd my people Israel.'"
\m

\s5
\v 7 Then Herod secretly called the learned men to ask them exactly what time the star had appeared.
\v 8 He sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search carefully for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him."

\s5
\v 9 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star that they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood still over where the young child was.
\v 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.

\s5
\v 11 They went into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother. They bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasures and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
\v 12 God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they departed to their own country by another way.

\s5
\p
\v 13 After they had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Remain there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
\v 14 That night Joseph rose and took the young child and his mother and departed into Egypt.
\v 15 He remained there until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet, "Out of Egypt I have called my son."

\s5
\p
\v 16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been mocked by the learned men, was very angry. He sent and killed all the male children that were in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old and under, according to the time that he had determined exactly from the learned men.

\s5
\v 17 Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet,
\q
\v 18 "A voice was heard in Ramah,
\q weeping and great mourning,
\q Rachel weeping for her children,
\q and she refused to be comforted, because they were no more."

\s5
\p
\v 19 When Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said,
\v 20 "Get up and take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
\v 21 Joseph rose, took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

\s5
\v 22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. After God warned him in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee
\v 23 and went and lived in a city called Nazareth. This fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.

\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying,
\v 2 "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."
\v 3 For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
\q "The voice of someone calling out in the wilderness,
\q 'Make ready the way of the Lord,
\q make his paths straight.'"
\m

\s5
\v 4 Now John wore clothing of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
\v 5 Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan River went out to him.
\v 6 They were baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.

\s5
\v 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him for baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of poisonous snakes, who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming?
\v 8 Bear fruit worthy of repentance.
\v 9 And do not think of saying among yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham even out of these stones.

\s5
\v 10 Already the ax has been placed against the root of the trees. So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.
\v 11 I baptize you with water for repentance. But he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am not worthy even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
\v 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand to thoroughly clear off his threshing floor and to gather his wheat into the storehouse. But he will burn up the chaff with fire that can never be put out."

\s5
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
\v 14 But John kept trying to stop him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
\v 15 Jesus responded and said to him, "Permit it now, for it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John permitted him.

\s5
\v 16 After he was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and alighting on him.
\v 17 Behold, a voice came out of the heavens saying, "This is my beloved Son. I am very pleased with him."

\s5
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
\v 2 When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
\v 3 The tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."
\v 4 But Jesus answered and said to him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God.'"

\s5
\v 5 Then the devil took him into the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple building,
\v 6 and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,
\q 'He will command his angels to take care of you,'
\m and,
\q 'They will lift you up in their hands,
\q so that you will not hit your foot against a stone.'"
\m

\s5
\v 7 Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You must not test the Lord your God.'"
\v 8 Again, the devil took him up to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world along with all their splendor.
\v 9 He said to him, "All these things I will give you, if you bow down and worship me."

\s5
\v 10 Then Jesus said to him, "Go away from here, Satan! For it is written, 
\q 'You will worship the Lord your God, 
\q and you will serve him only.'"
\p
\v 11 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.
\v 13 He left Nazareth and went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the Sea of Galilee, in the territories of Zebulun and Naphtali.

\s5
\v 14 This happened to fulfill what was said by Isaiah the prophet,
\q1
\v 15 "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
\q1 toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
\q1 Galilee of the Gentiles!
\q1
\v 16 The people who sat in darkness
\q1 have seen a great light,
\q1 and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,
\q1 upon them has a light arisen."

\s5
\p
\v 17 From that time Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."

\s5
\v 18 As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
\v 19 Jesus said to them, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
\v 20 Immediately they left the nets and followed him.

\s5
\v 21 As Jesus was going on from there he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee, and John his brother. They were in the boat with Zebedee their father mending their nets. He called them,
\v 22 and they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.

\s5
\p
\v 23 Jesus went about in all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and sickness among the people.
\v 24 The news about him went out into all of Syria, and the people brought to him all those who were sick, ill with various diseases and pains, those possessed by demons, and the epileptic and paralytic. Jesus healed them.
\v 25 Large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.

\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
\v 2 He opened his mouth and taught them, saying, 
\p
\q
\v 3 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, 
\q2 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\q
\v 4 Blessed are those who mourn, 
\q2 for they will be comforted.
\q

\s5
\v 5 Blessed are the meek,
\q2 for they will inherit the earth.
\q
\v 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
\q2 for they will be filled.
\q
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful,
\q2 for they will obtain mercy.
\q
\v 8 Blessed are the pure in heart, 
\q2 for they will see God.
\q

\s5
\v 9 Blessed are the peacemakers, 
\q2 for they will be called sons of God.
\q
\v 10 Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, 
\q2 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

\s5
\p
\v 11 Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, or say all kinds of evil things against you falsely for my sake.
\v 12 Rejoice and be very glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For in this way people persecuted the prophets who lived before you.

\s5
\p
\v 13 You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again? It is never again good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.

\s5
\v 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather on the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house. 
\v 16 Let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in heaven.

\s5
\p
\v 17 Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have come not to destroy them, but to fulfill them.
\v 18 For truly I say to you that until heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things shall have been accomplished.

\s5
\v 19 Therefore whoever breaks the least one of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever keeps them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will in no way enter the kingdom of heaven.

\s5
\p
\v 21 You have heard that it was said to them in ancient times, 'Do not kill,' and, 'Whoever kills will be in danger of the judgment.'
\v 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of the judgment. And whoever 
says to his brother, 'You worthless person!' will be in danger of the council. And whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.

\s5
\v 23 Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you,
\v 24 leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go on your way. First be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.

\s5
\v 25 Agree with your accuser quickly while you are with him on the way to court, or your accuser may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.
\v 26 Truly I say to you, you will never come out from there until you have paid the last bit of money you owe.

\s5
\p
\v 27 You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.'
\v 28 But I say to you that everyone who looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

\s5
\v 29 And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is better for you that one of your body parts should perish than that your whole body should be thrown into hell.
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is better for you that one of your body parts should perish than that your whole body should go into hell.

\s5
\v 31 It was also said, 'Whoever sends his wife away, let him give her a certificate of divorce.'
\v 32 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress. And whoever marries her after she has been divorced commits adultery.

\s5
\p
\v 33 Again, you have heard that it was said to those in ancient times, 'Do not swear a false oath, but carry out your oaths to the Lord.'
\v 34 But I say to you, swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
\v 35 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool for his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.

\s5
\v 36 Neither swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
\v 37 But let your speech be, 'Yes, yes,' or 'No, no.' Anything that is more than this is from the evil one.

\s5
\p
\v 38 You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'
\v 39 But I say to you, do not resist one who is evil. Instead, whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.

\s5
\v 40 And if anyone wishes to go to court with you and takes away your coat, let that person also have your cloak.
\v 41 And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
\v 42 Give to anyone who asks you, and do not turn away from anyone who wishes to borrow from you.

\s5
\p
\v 43 You have heard that it was said, 'You will love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
\v 44 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
\f + The best ancient copies omit \fqa "Bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you."\f*
\v 45 so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.

\s5
\v 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you get? Do not even the tax collectors do the same thing?
\v 47 And if you greet only your brothers, what do you do more than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same thing?
\v 48 Therefore you must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

\s5
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Take heed that you do not do your acts of righteousness before people to be seen by them, or else you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
\v 2 So when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before yourself as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have the praise of people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.

\s5
\v 3 But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
\v 4 so that your gift may be given in secret. Then your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

\s5
\p
\v 5 And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.
\v 6 But you, when you pray, enter your inner chamber. Shut the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
\v 7 And when you pray, do not make useless repetitions as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard because of their much speaking.

\s5
\v 8 Therefore, do not be like them, for your Father knows what things you need before you ask him.
\v 9 Therefore pray like this: 
\q 'Our Father in heaven, 
\q2 may your name be sanctified.
\q2
\v 10 May your kingdom come.
\q2 May your will be done 
\q2 on earth as it is in heaven.
\q2 

\s5
\v 11 Give us today our daily bread.
\q2 
\v 12 Forgive us our debts, 
\q2 as we also have forgiven our debtors.
\q2 
\v 13 And do not bring us into temptation, 
\q2 but deliver us from the evil one.'
\f + The best ancient copies omit \fqa "For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen"\f*
\m

\s5
\v 14 For if you forgive people their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
\v 15 But if you do not forgive their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

\s5
\p
\v 16 Moreover, when you fast, do not have a mournful face as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to people as fasting. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.
\v 17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
\v 18 Thus you may not appear to people as fasting, but only to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret, will reward you.

\s5
\p
\v 19 Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
\v 20 Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

\s5
\v 22 The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light.
\v 23 But if your eye is bad, your whole body is full of darkness. Therefore, if the light that is in you is actually darkness, how great is that darkness!
\v 24 No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.

\s5
\v 25 Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drinkâ€”or about your body, what you will wear. For is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
\v 26 Look at the birds in the air. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not more valuable than they are?

\s5
\v 27 And which one of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his lifespan?
\v 28 And why are you anxious about clothing? Think about the lilies in the fields, how they grow. They do not work, and they do not spin cloth.
\v 29 Yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.

\s5
\v 30 If God so clothes the grass in the fields, which exists today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith?
\v 31 Therefore do not be anxious and say, 'What will we eat?' or, 'What will we drink?' or, 'What clothes will we wear?'

\s5
\v 32 For the Gentiles search for these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
\v 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you.
\v 34 Therefore, do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day has enough evil of its own. 

\s5
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Do not judge, and you will not be judged.
\v 2 For with the judgment you judge, you will be judged. And with the measure that you measure, it will be measured out to you.

\s5
\v 3 And why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
\v 4 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye,' while the log is in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brother's eye.

\s5
\v 6 Do not give what is holy to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls in front of the hogs. Otherwise they may trample them underfoot, and then turn and tear you to pieces.

\s5
\p
\v 7 Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you.
\v 8 For everyone who asks, receives. And everyone who seeks, finds. And to the person who knocks, it will be opened.
\v 9 Or is there any man among you who, if his son will ask him for a loaf of bread, will he give him a stone?
\v 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?

\s5
\v 11 Therefore, if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give good things to those who ask him?
\v 12 Therefore, whatever things you want people to do to you, you should also do to them, for this is the law and the prophets.

\s5
\p
\v 13 Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many people who go through it. 
\v 14 For narrow is the gate and narrow is the way that lead to life, and there are few who find it.

\s5
\p
\v 15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but are truly ravenous wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits you will know them. Do people gather grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles?
\v 17 In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but the bad tree produces bad fruit.

\s5
\v 18 A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
\v 19 Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\v 20 So then, you will recognized them by their fruits.

\s5
\v 21 Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but only whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 22 Many people will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, in your name drive out demons, and in your name do many mighty deeds?'
\v 23 Then will I openly declare to them, 'I never knew you! Get away from me, you evildoers!'

\s5
\p
\v 24 Therefore, everyone who hears my words and obeys them will be like a wise man who built his house upon a rock.
\v 25 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, but it did not fall down, for it was built on the rock.

\s5
\v 26 But everyone who hears my words and does not obey them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.
\v 27 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew and struck that house. And it fell, and its destruction was complete."

\s5
\p
\v 28 It came about that when Jesus finished speaking these words, the crowds were astonished by his teaching,
\v 29 for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.

\s5
\c 8
\p
\v 1 When Jesus had come down from the hill, large crowds followed him.
\v 2 Behold, a leper came to him and bowed before him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
\v 3 Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing. Be clean." Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy.

\s5
\v 4 Jesus said to him, "See that you say nothing to any man. Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."

\s5
\p
\v 5 When Jesus had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him and asked him, 
\v 6 saying, "Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed and in terrible pain."
\v 7 Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."

\s5
\v 8 The centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, only say the word and my servant will be healed.
\v 9 For I also am a man who is placed under authority, and I have soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another one, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, "Truly I say to you, I have not found anyone with such faith in Israel. 

\s5
\v 11 I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and they will recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."
\v 13 Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! As you have believed, so may it be done for you." And the servant was healed at that very hour.

\s5
\p
\v 14 When Jesus had come into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
\v 15 Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and started serving him.

\s5
\v 16 When evening had come, the people brought to Jesus many who were controlled by demons. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick.
\v 17 In this way was fulfilled that which had been spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, "He himself took our sickness and bore our diseases."

\s5
\p
\v 18 Now when Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave instructions to leave for the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
\v 19 Then a scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
\v 20 Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."

\s5
\v 21 Another of the disciples said to him, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."
\v 22 But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."

\s5
\p
\v 23 When Jesus had entered a boat, his disciples followed him into it.
\v 24 Behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But Jesus was asleep.
\v 25 The disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, "Save us, Lord; we are about to die!"

\s5
\v 26 Jesus said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea. Then there was a great calm.
\v 27 The men marveled and said, "What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?"

\s5
\p
\v 28 When Jesus had come to the other side and to the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were controlled by demons met him. They were coming out of the tombs and were very violent, so that no traveler could pass that way. 
\v 29 Behold, they cried out and said, "What do we have to do with you, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the set time?"

\s5
\v 30 Now a herd of many pigs was there feeding, not too far away from them.
\v 31 The demons kept imploring Jesus and saying, "If you cast us out, send us away into that herd of pigs."
\v 32 Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out and went into the pigs. And behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep hill into the sea and they died in the water.

\s5
\v 33 The men who had been tending the pigs ran away. And when they went into the city they reported everything, especially what happened to the men who had been controlled by demons. 
\v 34 Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.

\s5
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Jesus entered a boat, crossed over, and came into his own city.
\v 2 Behold, they brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Son, be of good cheer. Your sins have been forgiven."

\s5
\v 3 Behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, "This man is blaspheming."
\v 4 Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?
\v 5 For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
\v 6 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, ... " he said to the paralytic, "Get up, pick up your mat, and go to your house."

\s5
\v 7 Then the man got up and went away to his house.
\v 8 When the crowds saw this, they were amazed and praised God, who had given such authority to people.
\v 9 As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man named Matthew, who was sitting at the tax collection place. He said to him, "Follow me." He got up and followed him.

\s5
\p
\v 10 As Jesus sat down to eat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinful people came and dined with Jesus and his disciples.
\v 11 When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinful people?"

\s5
\v 12 When Jesus heard this, he said, "People who are strong in body do not need a physician, only those who are sick.
\v 13 You should go learn what this means, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice.' For I came, not to call the righteous to repent, but sinners."

\s5
\p
\v 14 Then the disciples of John came to him and said, "Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
\v 15 Jesus said to them, "Can wedding attendants be sorrowful while the bridegroom is still with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.

\s5
\v 16 No man puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment, for the patch will tear away from the garment, and a worse tear will be made.

\s5
\v 17 Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be destroyed. Instead, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both will be preserved."

\s5
\p
\v 18 While Jesus was saying these things to them, behold, an official came and bowed down to him. He said, "My daughter has just now died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
\v 19 Then Jesus got up and followed him, and so did his disciples.

\s5
\v 20 Behold, a woman who had severe bleeding for twelve years, came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his garment.
\v 21 For she had said to herself, "If only I touch his clothes, I will be made well."
\v 22 But Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Daughter, take courage. Your faith has made you well." And the woman was instantly made well.

\s5
\v 23 When Jesus came into the official's house, he saw the flute players and the crowds making much noise.
\v 24 He said, "Go away, for the girl is not dead, but she is asleep." But they laughed at him in mockery.

\s5
\v 25 When the crowd had been put outside, he entered the room and took her by the hand, and the girl got up.
\v 26 The news about this spread into all that region.

\s5
\p
\v 27 As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him. They kept shouting and saying, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
\v 28 When Jesus had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."

\s5
\v 29 Then Jesus touched their eyes and said, "Let it be done to you according to your faith."
\v 30 And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus strictly commanded them and said, "See that no one knows about this."
\v 31 But the two men went out and spread the news about this throughout that region.

\s5
\p
\v 32 As those two men were going away, behold, a mute man possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus.
\v 33 When the demon had been driven out, the mute man spoke. The crowds were astonished and said, "This has never been seen before in Israel!"
\v 34 But the Pharisees were saying, "By the ruler of the demons, he drives out demons."

\s5
\p
\v 35 Jesus went about all the cities and the villages. He continued teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness.
\v 36 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were troubled and discouraged. They were like sheep without a shepherd.

\s5
\v 37 He said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
\v 38 Therefore urgently pray to the Lord of the harvest, so that he may send out laborers into his harvest."

\s5
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to drive them out, and to heal all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness.

\s5
\v 2 Now the names of the twelve apostles were these. The first, Simon (whom he also called Peter), and Andrew his brother; James son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
\v 3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
\v 4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who would betray him.

\s5
\p
\v 5 These twelve Jesus sent out. He instructed them and said, "Do not go to any place where Gentiles live, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
\v 6 Go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\v 7 And as you go, preach and say, 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'

\s5
\v 8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
\v 9 Do not carry any gold, silver, or brass in your purses.
\v 10 Do not take a traveling bag for your journey, or an extra tunic, or sandals, or a staff, for a laborer deserves his food.

\s5
\v 11 Whatever city or village you enter, find who is worthy in it, and stay there until you leave.
\v 12 As you enter into the house, greet it.
\v 13 If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace come back to you.

\s5
\v 14 As for those who do not receive you or listen to your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.
\v 15 Truly I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.

\s5
\p
\v 16 See, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be as wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
\v 17 Watch out for people! They will deliver you up to councils, and they will whip you in their synagogues.
\v 18 And you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.

\s5
\v 19 When they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you will speak, for what to say will be given to you in that hour.
\v 20 For it is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father who will speak in you.

\s5
\v 21 Brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death.
\v 22 You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But whoever endures to the end, that person will be saved.
\v 23 When they persecute you in this city, flee to the next, for truly I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man has come.

\s5
\p
\v 24 A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
\v 25 It is enough for the disciple that he should be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more would they defame his household!

\s5
\v 26 Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known.
\v 27 What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops.

\s5
\v 28 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul. Instead, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
\v 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's knowledge.
\v 30 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
\v 31 Do not fear. You are more valuable than many sparrows.

\s5
\v 32 Therefore everyone who confesses me before men, I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
\v 33 But he who denies me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.

\s5
\p
\v 34 Do not think that I came to bring peace upon the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
\v 35 For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
\v 36 A man's enemies will be those of his own household.

\s5
\v 37 He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
\v 38 He who does not pick up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me.
\v 39 He who finds his life will lose it. But he who loses his life for my sake will find it.

\s5
\p
\v 40 He who welcomes you welcomes me, and he who welcomes me also welcomes him who sent me.
\v 41 He who welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. And he who welcomes a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.

\s5
\v 42 Whoever gives to one of these little ones, even a cup of cold water to drink, because he is a disciple, truly I say to you, he will in no way lose his reward."

\s5
\c 11
\p
\v 1 It came about that when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
\v 2 Now when John heard in the prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent a message by his disciples
\v 3 and said to him, "Are you the Coming One, or is there another person we should be looking for?"

\s5
\v 4 Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you see and hear.
\v 5 Blind people are receiving sight, lame people are walking, lepers are being cleansed, deaf people are hearing again, dead people are being raised back to life, and needy people are being told the good news. 
\v 6 And blessed is whoever finds no occasion of stumbling over me."

\s5
\p
\v 7 As these men went on their way, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, "What did you go out in the desert to seeâ€”a reed being shaken by the wind?
\v 8 But what did you go out to seeâ€”a man dressed in soft clothing? Really, those who wear soft clothing live in kings' houses.

\s5
\v 9 But what did you go out to seeâ€”a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
\v 10 This is he of whom it was written,
\q 'See, I am sending my messenger before your face,
\q who will prepare your way before you.'
\m

\s5
\v 11 I say to you truly, among those born of women no one is greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is.
\v 12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force.

\s5
\v 13 For all the prophets and the law have been prophesying until John.
\v 14 And if you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, the one who was to come.
\v 15 He who has ears to hear, let him listen.

\s5
\v 16 To what should I compare this generation? It is like children playing in the marketplace, who sit and call to one another
\v 17 and say, 'We played a flute for you, and you did not dance. We mourned, and you did not weep.'

\s5
\v 18 For John came not eating bread or drinking wine, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by her deeds."

\s5
\p
\v 20 Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty deeds were done, because they had not repented. 
\v 21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you.

\s5
\v 23 You, Capernaum, do you think you will be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to hades. For if in Sodom there had been done the mighty deeds that were done in you, it would still have remained until today.
\v 24 But I say to you that it shall be easier for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you."

\s5
\p
\v 25 At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little children.
\v 26 Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
\v 27 All things have been entrusted to me from my Father. And no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him. 

\s5
\v 28 Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy burdened, and I will give you rest.
\v 29 Take my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
\v 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

\s5
\c 12
\p
\v 1 At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them. 
\v 2 But when the Pharisees saw that, they said to Jesus, "See, your disciples do what is unlawful to do on the Sabbath."

\s5
\v 3 But Jesus said to them, "Have you never read what David did, when he was hungry, and the men who were with him?
\v 4 How he went into the house of God and ate the bread of the presence, which was unlawful for him to eat, and unlawful for those who were with him, but lawful only for the priests?

\s5
\v 5 And have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath but are guiltless?
\v 6 But I say to you that one greater than the temple is here.

\s5
\v 7 If you had known what this meant, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless.
\v 8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."

\s5
\p
\v 9 Then Jesus left from there and went into their synagogue.
\v 10 Behold, there was a man having a dried-up hand. The Pharisees asked Jesus, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse him of sinning.

\s5
\v 11 Jesus said to them, "What man would there be among you, who, if he had just one sheep, and if this sheep fell into a deep hole on the Sabbath, would not grasp hold of it and lift it out?
\v 12 How much more of value, then, is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."

\s5
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored to health, just like the other hand.
\v 14 But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him. They were seeking how they might put him to death.

\s5
\p
\v 15 As Jesus perceived this, he withdrew from there. Many people followed him, and he healed them all. 
\v 16 He commanded them not to make him known to others,
\v 17 that it might come true, what had been said through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\q

\s5
\v 18 "See, my servant whom I have chosen;
\q my beloved one, in whom my soul is well pleased.
\q I will put my Spirit upon him,
\q and he will announce judgment to the Gentiles.
\q

\s5
\v 19 He will not strive nor cry aloud;
\q neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
\q
\v 20 He will not break any bruised reed;
\q he will not quench any smoking flax,
\q until he sends out judgment to victory.
\q
\v 21 And the Gentiles will have confidence in his name."

\s5
\p
\v 22 Then someone blind and mute, possessed by a demon, was brought to Jesus. He healed him, with the result that the mute man spoke and saw.
\v 23 All the crowds were amazed and said, "Can this man be the son of David?"

\s5
\v 24 But when the Pharisees heard of this miracle, they said, "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the prince of the demons."
\v 25 But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.

\s5
\v 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How will his kingdom stand?
\v 27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.

\s5
\v 28 But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
\v 29 And how can anyone enter the house of the strong man and steal his belongings without tying up the strong man first? Then he will steal his belongings from his house. 
\v 30 The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters.

\s5
\v 31 Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
\v 32 And whoever speaks any word against the Son of Man, that will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, that will not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.

\s5
\v 33 Either make a tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt, for a tree is known by its fruit.
\v 34 You offspring of vipers, since you are evil, how can you say good things? For out of the content of the heart the mouth speaks.
\v 35 The good man from the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil.

\s5
\v 36 And I say to you that in the day of judgment people will give an account for every idle word they will have said. 
\v 37 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."

\s5
\p
\v 38 Then certain scribes and Pharisees answered Jesus and said, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you."
\v 39 But Jesus answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign. But no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. 
\v 40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the big fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

\s5
\v 41 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation of people and will condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and see, someone greater than Jonah is here.

\s5
\v 42 The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn it. She came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and see, someone greater than Solomon is here.

\s5
\v 43 When an unclean spirit has gone away from a man, it passes through waterless places and looks for rest, but does not find it. 
\v 44 Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' Having returned, it finds that house swept out and put in order.
\v 45 Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all come in to live there. Then the final condition of that man becomes worse than the first. It will be just like that with this evil generation."

\s5
\p
\v 46 While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.
\v 47 Someone said to him, "Look, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you."

\s5
\v 48 But Jesus answered and said to him who told him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
\v 49 Then he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said, "See, here are my mother and my brothers!
\v 50 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, that person is my brother, and sister, and mother."

\s5
\c 13
\p
\v 1 On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.
\v 2 A very large crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat in it. All the crowd stood on the beach.

\s5
\v 3 Then Jesus said many things to them in parables. He said, "Behold, a sower went out to sow.
\v 4 As he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and devoured them.
\v 5 Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. Immediately they sprang up, because the soil had no depth.
\v 6 But when the sun had risen, they were scorched because they had no root, and they withered away.

\s5
\v 7 Other seeds fell among the thorn plants. The thorn plants grew up and choked them.
\v 8 Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.
\v 9 He who has ears, let him listen."

\s5
\p
\v 10 The disciples came and said to Jesus, "Why do you talk to the crowd in parables?"
\v 11 Jesus answered and said to them, "You have been given the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
\v 12 Because whoever has, to him will be given more, and he will have a great deal. But whoever has not, from him will be taken away even what he has.

\s5
\v 13 So I talk to them in parables, because although they see, they do not really see. And although they hear, they do not really hear, neither do they understand.
\v 14 To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that which says, 
\q 'While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand;
\q while seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive.
\q

\s5
\v 15 For this people's heart has become dull,
\q and they are hard of hearing,
\q and they have closed their eyes,
\q so they should not see with their eyes,
\q or hear with their ears,
\q or understand with their hearts,
\q so they would turn again,
\q and I would heal them.'
\m

\s5
\v 16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
\v 17 Truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things that you see, and did not see them. They desired to hear the things that you hear, and did not hear them.

\s5
\v 18 Listen then to the parable of the sower.
\v 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, then the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the seed that was sown beside the road.

\s5
\v 20 He who was sown on the rocky ground is he who hears the word and receives it with joy immediately.
\v 21 Yet he has no root in himself but endures for only a little while. When tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he stumbles immediately. 

\s5
\v 22 He who was sown among the thorn plants, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 He who was sown on the good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it. This is he who truly produces fruit and cultivates it; some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty."

\s5
\p
\v 24 Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
\v 25 But while people slept, his enemy came and also sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away.
\v 26 When the blades sprouted and then produced their crop, then the weeds appeared also.

\s5
\v 27 The servants of the landowner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How does it now have weeds?'
\v 28 He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' The servants said to him, 'So do you want us to go and pull them out?'

\s5
\v 29 The landowner said, 'No, or when you pull out the weeds, you might uproot the wheat with them. 
\v 30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, "First pull out the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn."'"

\s5
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field. 
\v 32 This seed is indeed the smallest of all other seeds. But when it has grown, it is greater than the garden plants. It becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches."

\s5
\v 33 Jesus then told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until it rose."

\s5
\p
\v 34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables. And without parables he said nothing to them.
\v 35 This was in order that what had been said through the prophet might come true, when he said,
\q "I will open my mouth in parables.
\q I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world."

\s5
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field."
\v 37 Jesus answered and said, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
\v 38 The field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,
\v 39 and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are angels.

\s5
\v 40 Therefore, as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the world.
\v 41 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the things that cause sin, and those who commit iniquity.
\v 42 They will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
\v 43 Then will the righteous people shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him listen.

\s5
\p
\v 44 The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found it and hid it. In his joy he goes, sells everything he possesses, and buys that field. 
\v 45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a merchant looking for valuable pearls.
\v 46 When he found one pearl of very great value, he went and sold everything that he possessed and bought it.

\s5
\p
\v 47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and that gathered creatures of every kind.
\v 48 When it was filled, the fishermen drew it up on the beach. Then they sat down and gathered the good things into containers, but the worthless things they threw away.

\s5
\v 49 It will be this way at the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
\v 50 They will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.

\s5
\p
\v 51 Have you understood all these things?" The disciples said to him, "Yes."
\v 52 Then Jesus said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is the owner of a house, who withdraws old and new things from his treasure."
\v 53 Then it came about that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from that place.

\s5
\p
\v 54 Then Jesus entered his own region and taught the people in their synagogue. The result was that they were astonished and said, "Where does this man get his wisdom and these miracles from?
\v 55 Is not this man the carpenter's son? Is not his mother Mary? And his brothers, are they not James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
\v 56 And his sisters, are they not all among us? So where does this man get all these things from?"

\s5
\v 57 They were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own family."
\v 58 And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
